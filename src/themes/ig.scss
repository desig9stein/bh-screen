// the entire application.  In case you want the theme to apply to the entire
// app, the below example has been provided.  You can include the below example
// in your 'styles.scss' and adjust which generated theme you want to apply by
// changing the 'themeNameFolder' name in the palette and typography lines to match
// the folder name containing the desired theme.
//
// You will also need to add the 'igx-typography' CSS class to your <body> tag in
// index.html in order for the typography settings to apply to everything in the app.
